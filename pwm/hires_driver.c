 * \brief
 *      XMEGA HiRes driver source file.
 *
 *      This file contains the function implementations the XMEGA HiRes driver.
 *
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code, since
 *      most functions are just a few lines of code, and the function call
 *      overhead would decrease code performance. The driver is intended for
 *      rapid prototyping and documentation purposes for getting started with
 *      the XMEGA HiRes module.
 *
 *      For size and/or speed critical code, it is recommended to copy the
 *      function contents directly into your application instead of making
 *      a function call.
 *
 * \par Application note:
 *      AVR1311: Using the XMEGA Timer/Counter Extensions.
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html
