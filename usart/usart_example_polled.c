 * \brief  XMEGA polled USART driver example source.
 *
 *      This file contains an example application that demonstrates the polled
 *      USART driver. The code example sends all values between 0 and 255 and
 *      checks that the values received are equal to the values sent. It can be
 *      tested, using a loop-back wire between I/O pins PC2 and PC3.

 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html

 *
 *  Example applicaton. This example configures USARTC0 for with the parameters:
 *      - 8 bit character size
 *      - No parity
 *      - 1 stop bit
 *      - 9600 Baud
 *
 *  This function then sends the values 0-255 and tests if the received data is
 *  equal to the sent data. The code can be tested by connecting PC3 to PC2. If
 *  the variable 'success' is true at the end of the function, the values
 *  have been successfully sent and received.
