 * \brief  XMEGA USART interrupt driven driver example source.
 *
 *      This file contains an example application that demonstrates the
 *      interrupt driven USART driver. The code example sends three bytes, waits
 *      for three bytes to be received and tests if the received data equals the
 *      sent data.

 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html

 *      - 8 bit character size
 *      - No parity
 *      - 1 stop bit
 *      - 9600 Baud

 *  This function then sends three bytes and tests if the received data is
 *  equal to the sent data. The code can be tested by connecting PC3 to PC2. If
 *  the variable 'success' is true at the end of the function, the three bytes
 *  have been successfully sent and received.
